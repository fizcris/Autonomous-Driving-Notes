### Visualize hidden layers 
```
# image_input: the test image being fed into the network to produce the feature maps
# tf_activation: should be a tf variable name used during your training procedure that represents the calculated state of a specific weight layer
# Note: that to get access to tf_activation, the session should be interactive which can be achieved with the following commands.
# sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
# sess.as_default()

# activation_min/max: can be used to view the activation contrast in more detail, by default matplot sets min and max to the actual min and    max values of the output
# plt_num: used to plot out multiple different weight feature map sets on the same block, just extend the plt number for each new feature map entry

def outputFeatureMap(image_input, tf_activation, activation_min=-1, activation_max=-1 ,plt_num=1):
    # Here make sure to preprocess your image_input in a way your network expects
    # with size, normalization, ect if needed
    # image_input =
    # Note: x should be the same name as your network's tensorflow data placeholder variable
    # If you get an error tf_activation is not defined it maybe having trouble accessing the variable from inside a function
    activation = tf_activation.eval(session=sess,feed_dict={x : image_input})
    featuremaps = activation.shape[3]
    plt.figure(plt_num, figsize=(15,15))
    for featuremap in range(featuremaps):
        plt.subplot(6,8, featuremap+1) # sets the number of feature maps to show on each row and column
        plt.title('FeatureMap ' + str(featuremap)) # displays the feature map number
        if activation_min != -1 & activation_max != -1:
            plt.imshow(activation[0,:,:, featuremap], interpolation="nearest", vmin =activation_min, vmax=activation_max, cmap="gray")
        elif activation_max != -1:
            plt.imshow(activation[0,:,:, featuremap], interpolation="nearest", vmax=activation_max, cmap="gray")
        elif activation_min !=-1:
            plt.imshow(activation[0,:,:, featuremap], interpolation="nearest", vmin=activation_min, cmap="gray")
        else:
